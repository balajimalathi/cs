### **🔹 7. Peripheral Vision Training**

### **🔹 8. Chunking & Number Association (Peg System)**  
**Best for:** Memorizing numbers and lists  

✅ **How to practice:**  
1. Convert numbers into **visual stories** (e.g., 1498 = Vasco da Gama arriving in India).  
2. Group **large numbers** into smaller **meaningful chunks**.  

🧠 **Example:**  
Instead of memorizing **1857**, think **“1 = Cannon, 8 = Soldiers, 5 = Battle, 7 = Victory”**.
