## Register Transfer Language (RTL)

Register Transfer Language is used to describe the operations and data transfers between registers in a digital system. It provides a symbolic notation for micro-operations.

* **Notation Example**:
  * `R1 ← R2` : Transfer content of R2 to R1
  * `R3 ← R1 + R2` : Add contents of R1 and R2 and store result in R3

**Real-world**: RTL is used in CPU design to describe how instructions execute at the register level.

## Bus and Memory Transfers

### Bus:

A **bus** is a shared communication pathway that transfers data between components.

* **Data Bus**: Transfers actual data
* **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses
* **Control Bus**: Carries control signals (Read/Write)

### Memory Transfers:

* `Read`: Memory → Register (e.g., `R1 ← M[1000]`)
* `Write`: Register → Memory (e.g., `M[1000] ← R1`)

**Real-world**: Modern CPUs use buses to connect RAM, cache, and I/O devices.

## Arithmetic Microoperations

Arithmetic microoperations perform basic arithmetic operations on binary data stored in registers.

### Common Operations:

* **Addition**: `R3 ← R1 + R2`
* **Subtraction**: `R3 ← R1 - R2` (done via 2's complement)
* **Increment**: `R1 ← R1 + 1`
* **Decrement**: `R1 ← R1 - 1`
* **Negation**: `R1 ← -R1`

**Real-world**: ALU inside processors executes these operations constantly during computations.

***

## Logic Microoperations

Logic microoperations perform bitwise operations.

### Types:

* **AND**: `R1 ← R1 AND R2`
* **OR**: `R1 ← R1 OR R2`
* **XOR**: `R1 ← R1 XOR R2`
* **NOT**: `R1 ← NOT R1`

**Use-case**: Used in encryption, bit masking, and control signal generation.

***

## Shift Microoperations

Shift microoperations move bits within a register.

### Types:

* **Logical Shift Left (LSL)**: Shift bits left, insert 0 on right
* **Logical Shift Right (LSR)**: Shift bits right, insert 0 on left
* **Arithmetic Shift Right**: Maintains sign bit for signed numbers
* **Rotate Left/Right**: Bits wrap around (circular shift)

**Real-world**: Used in multiplication/division by powers of two, cryptography, and checksum algorithms.
