## **1. Introduction to Microprogrammed Control**

Microprogrammed control is an approach to designing the **control unit** of a CPU where control signals are generated by executing a sequence of microinstructions stored in **control memory**. This method offers flexibility and simplicity compared to hardwired control.

### **Key Components**

* **Control Memory (Microprogram Memory):** Stores microinstructions that define control signals.
* **Microinstructions:** Low-level instructions that specify control operations.
* **Address Sequencing Logic:** Determines the next microinstruction to execute.

***

## **2. Control Memory**

Control memory is a high-speed memory that stores **microprograms** (sequences of microinstructions). Each microinstruction generates control signals for one or more CPU operations.

### **Characteristics**

* **Read-only (ROM) or writable (WRAM):** Typically ROM for fixed operations, WRAM for adaptable systems.
* **Width:** Determines how many control signals can be generated simultaneously.
* **Depth:** Number of microinstructions stored.

### **Example**

* A microinstruction might encode:
  * **ALU operation (ADD, SUB)**
  * **Register selection (R1, R2)**
  * **Memory access (Read/Write)**

### **Real-World Example**

* **Intel x86 processors** use microprogrammed control for complex instruction sets (CISC).

### **Model Question (UGC NET)**

**Q:** Why is control memory often implemented as ROM in microprogrammed control units?\
**A:** Because microprograms are typically fixed during operation, making ROM a cost-effective and reliable storage solution.

## **3. Address Sequencing**

Address sequencing determines how the next microinstruction address is generated. It involves:

### **Methods of Address Sequencing**

1. **Incremental Sequencing**
   * Next address = Current address + 1
   * Used for linear microinstruction sequences.

2. **Branching (Conditional/Unconditional)**
   * Changes flow based on status flags (e.g., Zero flag).
   * Example: `IF (Z=1) THEN JUMP <address>`

3. **Mapping from Machine Instruction Opcode**
   * The opcode of a machine instruction maps to a starting address in control memory.

4. **Subroutine Calls**
   * Microprograms can call and return from subroutines.

### **Example**

* **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:**
  1. Fetch instruction â†’ Map opcode to microprogram start address.
  2. Execute microinstructions sequentially.
  3. Branch based on condition (e.g., overflow).

### **Real-World Example**

* **Modern GPUs** use microprogrammed control with complex branching for parallel processing.

### **Model Question (UGC NET)**

**Q:** What is the role of address sequencing in a microprogrammed control unit?\
**A:** It determines the next microinstruction to execute, enabling operations like linear execution, branching, and subroutine handling.

***

## **4. Design of Control Unit**

The design involves organizing microinstructions and control memory for efficient operation.

### **Key Design Considerations**

* **Horizontal vs. Vertical Microprogramming**
  * **Horizontal:** Wide microinstructions (many control signals in parallel).
  * **Vertical:** Narrow microinstructions (encoded, requires decoding).

* **Microinstruction Format**
  * **Control Field:** Specifies operations (e.g., ALU, memory access).
  * **Address Field:** Next microinstruction address.

* **Control Store Optimization**
  * Minimizing microprogram size while maintaining performance.

### **Example**

* **Horizontal Microinstruction:**\
  `ALU_OP=ADD, REG_SEL=R1, MEM_ACCESS=READ, NEXT_ADDR=120`

* **Vertical Microinstruction:**\
  `0001` (Encoded as ADD operation)

### **Real-World Example**

* **IBM System/360** used horizontal microprogramming for flexibility across models.

### **Model Question (UGC NET)**

**Q:** Compare horizontal and vertical microprogramming.\
**A:** Horizontal microprogramming allows **parallel control signals** (faster but wider), while vertical uses **encoded microinstructions** (compact but requires decoding).
